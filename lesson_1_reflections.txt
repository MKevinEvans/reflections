How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It isolated the points where the two files had changed and it gave me a reference to compare the broken file to.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I could reflect back to see versions of documents before changes were made
