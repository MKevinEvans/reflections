How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It acts like a milk crate for you to put things into before taking them all into the repository.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

I can more clearly see where new features occur, as well as which results from which commits will be affecting the tip of whatever branch I am on.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The result is a single branch with all of the additions and deletions of either branches. The diagram portrayal is done to show that even though they are merged as one single branch, the integrity of the lineage is still upheld.
