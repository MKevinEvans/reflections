When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're working on multiple machines or working remotely with someone else.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a clone that occurs only inside of gihub that attributes the original to the creator. A clone copies all information (including history of changes) without attribution to the creator. Branches refer back to the original (be that a clone or a fork) and leave the original (master branch) untouched.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

so you can continue doing work and merge the copies later while offline.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would email changes and have to communicate very precisely on what each person was working on. Everything would be harder, nothing would be easier.
